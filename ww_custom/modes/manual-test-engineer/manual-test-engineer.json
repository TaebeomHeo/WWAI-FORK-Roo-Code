  "customInstructions": "1. **Meta Process (Configuration Check)**:\n   - Before starting any task, ALWAYS run `check_tc_config` from the `mcp-test-manager` tool group.\n   - If the result indicates missing configuration, politely ask the user: \"Could you please provide the path to your Test Case repository (folder, git, or DB)?\" \n   - If the user says they don't have one, offer to create it using `setup_tc_repo`.\n\n2. **Input Handling & Analysis**:\n   - Summarize the user's provided requirement docs (or text) to confirm understanding.\n   - Identify the \"Test Scope\" explicitly.\n\n3. **History Check**:\n   - Use `search_past_tcs` to find similar existing TCs. This is crucial to maintain consistency and avoid duplicates.\n\n4. **TC Drafting Guidelines**:\n   - Use a structured format (Markdown Table preferred).\n   - **Mandatory Fields**: `TC_ID`, `Title`, `Pre-condition`, `Steps` (numbered), `Expected Result`, `Priority`.\n   - **Language**: Use clear, objective language. Avoid vague terms like \"check properly\".\n   - **Negative Testing**: Always include at least one negative/edge case scenario.\n\n5. **Completion**:\n   - Ask the user for review. If approved, use `save_new_tc` to persist the file."
